<br/>Hey there, I am from Malaysia and I am in my final semester studying Bachelor of Business, 
majoring in Logistics & Supply Chain Management.<br/>

<br/>I am 26 years old, living in the South east suburb of Melbourne.
I can speak English, Mandarin, and Malay. Not so fluent in Cantonese, Hokkien and Hakka.<br/>

<br/>I like playing games, listening to music, playing badminton, work on my car, go for a drive. 
Used to study in Singapore and was in a band as a  drummer called Take Cover, 
we play mostly from Metal to Classic Rock. Also used to work in a drum shop.<br/></p>

<h1>Interest in IT:</h1>
<p>
<br/>My interest in IT starts around a year ago when I decided to build myself a desktop. It was quite 
the pleasant experience as I have help from some youtube videos and friends who guided me on somne tips and basics on building
a desktop system.<br/>

<br/>Not only that, during my course I have encountered softwares used in Logistics & Supply Chain Management such as 
the (WMS) warehouse management system, Electronic Customer Relationship Management (ECRM), Transport Management System (TMS) 
and the application on cloud computing in the context of Logistics & Supply Chain Management.<br/>

<br/>I choose RMIT because coming from Monash College, I have heard that RMIT offers this specific logistics and supply 
chain management course which I have interest in when I was about to finish my Diploma of Business in Monash. In
addition, Monash does not offer the course and RMIT school fees is cheaper than Monash.<br/>

<br/>I expect to learn more about the fundamentals of IT in general for this course which should be beneficial and fun.<br/></p>

<br/>As a Delivery Station Manager in Amazon, I am in charge of overseeing the warehouse facility, ensuring delivery process is as
efficient as it can be. I will also be leading a team of Shift Managers and Shift Assistants. In addition, ensuring a positive working 
space and good work relationships on everyday basis. I will also be working along with important business partners such as Transport &
