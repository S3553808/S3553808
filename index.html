<br/>Hey there, I am from Malaysia and I am in my final semester studying Bachelor of Business, 
majoring in Logistics & Supply Chain Management.<br/>

<br/>I am 26 years old, living in the South east suburb of Melbourne.
I can speak English, Mandarin, and Malay. Not so fluent in Cantonese, Hokkien and Hakka.<br/>

<br/>I like playing games, listening to music, playing badminton, work on my car, go for a drive. 
Used to study in Singapore and was in a band as a  drummer called Take Cover, 
we play mostly from Metal to Classic Rock. Also used to work in a drum shop.<br/></p>

<h1>Interest in IT:</h1>
<p>
<br/>My interest in IT starts around a year ago when I decided to build myself a desktop. It was quite 
the pleasant experience as I have help from some youtube videos and friends who guided me and gave me tips and basics on building
a desktop system.<br/>

<br/>Not only that, during my course I have encountered softwares used in Logistics & Supply Chain Management such as 
the (WMS) warehouse management system, Electronic Customer Relationship Management (ECRM), Transport Management System (TMS) 
and the application on cloud computing in the context of Logistics & Supply Chain Management.<br/>

<br/>I choose RMIT because coming from Monash College, I have heard that RMIT offers this specific logistics and supply 
chain management course which I have interest in when I was about to finish my Diploma of Business in Monash. In
addition, Monash does not offer the course and RMIT school fees is cheaper than Monash.<br/>

<br/>I expect to learn more about the fundamentals of IT in general for this course which should be beneficial and fun.<br/></p>

<h2>Big Five Personality Test:</h2>

<br/>The test shows that I have strong result in all four area (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness
and Neuroticism). These score ranges between 2.8 to 3.7 with the highest score belonging to Agreeableness whereas 
the lowest score is Extraversion with just only 2.0.<br/>

<br/>These results do show that I am fairly introverted. In order for me to work better in team, I should be less nervous
and start to be more socialise and overcome my own personal social anxiety. I think I can work on my social and 
leadership capabilities, improve my communication skills and I also need to feel less unappreciated and undervalued.<br/><p>
