<h1>Personal Information:</h1>
<p>
Name: Ee Kien Toh <br/>
Student Number: S3553808 <br/>
Email address: s3553808@student.rmit.edu.au <br/>

<br/>Hey there, I am from Malaysia and I am in my final semester studying Bachelor of Business, 
majoring in Logistics & Supply Chain Management. Before studying in RMIT I used to study my Diploma of Business in Monash College, and I also used to study in Singapore during my high school years. <br/>

<br/>I am currently 26 years old, living in the South east suburb of Melbourne. I have been in Melbourne for around 4 years now and I really liking it here. I can speak English, Mandarin, and Malay. Not so fluent in Cantonese, Hokkien and Hakka.<br/>

<br/>I like playing computer games, listening to music, playing badminton, work on my car and go for a drive. 
Back when I was in Singapore I was in a band as a  drummer called Take Cover, we won a few band competitions which were unexpected. 
we play mostly from Metal to Classic Rock but also some Radio Hits. Lastly, I also used to work in a drum shop for 2 months as a sales assistant.<br/></p>

<h1>Interest in IT:</h1>
<p>
<br/>My interest in IT is generally on how it can be implemented in Logistics & Supply Chain Management. My interest in IT started around a year ago when a friend of mine advised me on building a desktop instead of just buying another laptop. So, I decided to save some money and build myself a desktop. It was quite 
the pleasant experience as I have help from some Youtube videos and friends who guided me and gave me tips and basics on building
a desktop system. On top of that, when I was young I remember my parents putting me in some beginner computer classes as well. Not only that, during my course I have encountered a few software used in Logistics & Supply Chain Management such as 
the (WMS) Warehouse Management System, Electronic Customer Relationship Management (ECRM), Transport Management System (TMS) 
and the application on cloud computing in the context of Logistics & Supply Chain Management.<br/>

<br/>I choose RMIT because coming from Monash College, I have heard that RMIT offers this specific Logistics and Supply 
Chain Management course which I have interest in when I was about to finish my Diploma of Business in Monash. In
addition, Monash does not offer the course and RMIT school fees is cheaper than Monash.<br/>

<br/>I expect to learn more about the general fundamentals of IT in general for this course which should be beneficial and fun. Specifically, I would like to learn more about HTML coding, AI, Robotics, and cloud storage as well because those are the items which I think will help me in my future endeavour.<br/></p>

<h2>Big Five Personality Test:</h2>

<br/>The test shows that I have strong result in all four area (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness
and Neuroticism). These score ranges between 2.8 to 3.7 with the highest score belonging to Agreeableness whereas 
the lowest score is Extraversion with just only 2.0.<br/>

<br/>These results do show that I am introverted. For me to work better in team, I should be less nervous
and start to be more socialise and overcome my own personal social anxiety. I think I can work on my social and 
leadership capabilities; improve my communication skills and I also need to feel less unappreciated and undervalued.<br/><p>
  
<h1>Project Idea:</h1>
<p>
<h2>Overview:</h2>

<br/>This project will be focusing on creating the ideal Transport Management System (TMS) for the current market. In order to achieve this, the system need to optimize the routing system, planning, decision making, transportation cost in the most efficient and effective manner, having clear visibility for all parties, have accurate logistics key performance indicator (KPI) to measure performance and quicker execution on transportation plan, including customers who is using the system, all parties can pinpoint the exact location of where the shipments are at any given time. This includes full access view from point A to point B, invoicing, booking and customs clearance (Robinson 2015).<br/> 

<h2>Motivation:</h2>

<br/>This TMS idea have always been my ideal IT project idea since I started studying Supply Chain Analysis and Design last semester. I find it interesting and useful and decide to delve into it because I personally think there is ways or room for improvement in improving the system and the demand and popularity for a Transport Management System software is always growing. By gathering a team of like-minded people, this project idea should not be too far-fetched and can be achieved if we work together as a team. But however, like almost any project idea, it is not as easy to just create one as having sufficient capital is important.<br/>

<h2>Description:</h2> 
  
<br/>What makes this TMS different from competitors features in terms of product or service is firstly, to emphasis on making it accessible/cheaper cost for Small Medium Enterprise (SME) as most competitors charge premium for software and services like this. The reason why most SME were not keen on using TMS is because of the ‘complexity’ of the system, high barrier to entry/high cost, and maintenance. To entice customers, we must educate and show how not using TMS can be at a great disadvantage. And lastly, customers have the option and able to choose to acquire this by either paying a one-off payment or a subscription service of either monthly, quarterly, or yearly at a reasonable rate (Robinson 2015).<br/>

<br/>To stand out from other competitors, it is key to make it user-friendly. Process like easy installation, ease of usage, not clunky/faster operation, more practical, and more efficient is also another important factor when it comes to creating the ideal TMS for customers. Furthermore, TMS can also automatically track many shipments, products, and solutions at the same time. It can also establish and consolidate information into something that is easy to read and clear-cut, which able to help with anyone using the system to make quick and clear decisions. With automation, it also reduces human errors significantly. Because of this, all customers can significantly take advantage of this system and ultimately lead to savings in cost and grow its efficiency level as high as possible as the customer can go (Robinson 2015).<br/>

<br/>Furthermore, this TMS idea will also develop a seamless cloud-based computing in which customers do not need to worry about having big and expensive servers or a dedicated IT team to maintain those system. Customers can open the cloud-bases system from anywhere in the world and utilsing this method is less costly for customers maintain, which may again attract more customers, especially SME. For example, customers can pick any freight forwarders or carries that they want from the comfort of their own office. And during this pandemic period, users can work from home simply because of having TMS as mentioned that they can be access from anywhere just with a click of the mouse button (Robinson 2015).<br/>

<br/>By having a proper TMS that help in choosing the right mode of transport, better routing, and better procurement process, improve customer satisfaction, increase warehouse efficiency, increase delivery capabilities, improve cash flows, reduce inventory and ultimately, all the above-mentioned features lead to savings in cost and increase in Return of Investment (ROI). <br/>

<h2>Tolls and Technologies:</h2>

<br/>In terms of software, hardware or another other equipment needed, firstly, forming the ideal team is important as this will set up the foundation of the software as having motivated and dedicated coders, software engineers, graphic artists, software developer, and more. In terms of hardware, which can be quite costly, is to probably set up a server room, which consist of server racks, computer servers, routers, switches, network cabling and cable management equipment Having a proper airflow in the room, proper cable management, physical security is just a few item to list in order to have a good server room. Probably have left out some other crucial elements but this is all I can think of as for now (Racksolutions 2019).<br/>
 
<h2>Skills Required:</h2>

<br/>For the skills that I needed for this project, which includes software that is needed to be written, firstly having computer science background and skills will be helpful. Not only that, knowing how to code is also important as well. Since I am coming from a business background, IT is essentially not my strongest point so I probably will hire the relevant people to help set up this software. The part which I can contribute is the logistics and supply chain management aspect of the transport management system which includes setting up vehicle routing and gathering data of carriers and freight forwarders. <br/>

<h2>Outcome:</h2> 
  
<br/> If this project is successful, the most likely outcome will be having more companies/business switching to our platform. As that happens, we also need to grow in terms of having more IT support, customer support and business development. The original problem will be having a large sum of capital so in order to combat that, having funded by investors will be ideal. Hopefully, the impact that this development has to this world is big as the high accessibility of this system means bringing better efficiency and reduce cost for many SME, companies, and business in the world. <br/>
